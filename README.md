1️⃣ Renovated Status: This KPI highlights the percentage of properties that have undergone renovation. By analyzing this metric, property managers can understand the impact of renovations on property values and make informed investment decisions.

2️⃣ Waterfront Status: Waterfront properties often carry a premium value. This KPI provides valuable insights into the percentage of properties located near bodies of water, allowing investors to identify potential opportunities or evaluate market trends.

3️⃣ Property Floors: Understanding the distribution of properties by the number of floors helps investors gauge market demand for specific types of properties. This KPI allows property managers to assess preferences and tailor their offerings accordingly.

4️⃣ Property Current Status: This metric categorizes properties based on their current status, such as "for sale," "rented," or "vacant." It enables property managers to monitor the market dynamics and make strategic decisions based on the demand and supply of properties.

5️⃣ Number of Bedrooms: Analyzing the distribution of properties by the number of bedrooms provides valuable insights into housing preferences. This KPI assists property managers in identifying target markets and tailoring their marketing strategies.

6️⃣ Build Year: Examining the distribution of properties by their build year helps in understanding the age of properties in the market. This KPI aids in identifying opportunities for renovations or developments.
